IDSP (integrated disease surveillance programme) dataset

ISSUES:

Districts change over time. 2001 had 593, 2011 had 640 and 2019 has 732.

Records with non numeric dates are not detected by idsp_parser.py

Follow up reports produce duplicates. Duplicates can be found using dataframe.duplicated() method. However, even matching for date, disease and district the report might just be a late one and not a follow up to previous reports:

```
Sathya Nagar village, Kannankurichi PHC (43 cases), Vasampalli Therkathi Kadu village, PHC Kolathur (12 cases), Poovanoor Colony village, Vaikuntham PHC (12 cases)

Jaya theatre colony, Sarkar kottapatty PHC,
```

no overlap in these lists of locations

Lots of missing data points

Incorrect spellings

New diseases reported
